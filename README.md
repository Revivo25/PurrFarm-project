PurrFarm is a cloud-based smart dashboard designed for precision agriculture. 
The system collects real-time IoT sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light), allows users to upload plant images, and analyzes plant health using AI to detect diseases, pests, and water stress. 
The platform includes a gamification layer (“Healthy Garden Race”) with daily tasks, weekly challenges, scoring, and ranking to encourage consistent plant care. 
✨ Features view and monitor plant data in real time 📸 Upload plant images for AI analysis.
